  <h2>Were you improperly ticketed while riding your bike in New York?</h2>
  <p>There are a lot of bicycle tickets written in New York City but we don't have great public data about them. We are gathering data on questionable bicycle tickets in order to better understand hyperactive policing of cyclists in New York City.</p>

  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  <p>This website exists to collect the information of those who have been ticketed in New York City while riding their bike.  The goal of this collection is to better understand the ticketing of cyclists and to eventually provide a foundation for challenging the way the City of New York treats cyclists.  Many tickets are <a href="http://drmtlaw.com/areas-of-practice/bikes/bike-law/" target="_blank">most likely not legally sound</a> but fighting them individually often costs more than the the fine.  Good data will help us fight more effectively.</p>

  <p><strong><em>We want to challenge the City's disproportionately aggressive policing of cyclists.</em></strong></p>

  <p>By providing information about your ticket you give permission for your information to be stored, used for analysis, and used as part of legal arguments regarding cycling in New York.  You may elect for your name to be public or private.  Public names appear published on this website.  Private names are stored in our database as signers and are counted in number.  All information provided will be presented for legal scrutiny.</p>

  <p>Your address, phone number, zip code, and email will be stored encrypted in our database.</p>
